## Whoami:

I'm a French student aspiring to reach a high level of technical skill in cybersecurity.

Currently working on a small project, an open-source collaborative documentation aiming to collect and share valuable resources for infosec enthusiasts.

I'm just getting started, but I try to write writeups as I go.
